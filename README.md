# TOP - Rock, Paper, Scissors

RPS is a test project from The Odin Project foundations path. This is my answer to this challenge.

## Phases

The first phase is vanilla JS, with UI to be added later.

## Challenge Specifics

"Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

Use prompt() to get the user input.

Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end."
